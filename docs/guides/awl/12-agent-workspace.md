# Without `awl` alias

Use the canonical binary directly:

```sh
agent-workspace-launcher --help
```

Examples:

```sh
agent-workspace-launcher create OWNER/REPO
agent-workspace-launcher ls
agent-workspace-launcher exec <workspace>
agent-workspace-launcher rm <workspace> --yes
```

`awl` is only a compatibility alias for the same command tree.
